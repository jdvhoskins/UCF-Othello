# Othello
A java implementation of Othello (or Reversi).

This project was originally assigned in an Object Oriented Programming class at the University of Central Florida. As such, I selected token colors and designed a board that were all UCF themed.

Compile as (from src directory): javac Othello.java

Optionally, the argument list in OthelloFiles.txt may be used. It assumes that there is a directory structure that matches src that is located in build\classes. The build directory should be at the same level as src.

Compile as (from src directory): javac @OthelloFiles.txt

If you are using PowerShell, put single quotes around @OthelloFiles.txt.

Run as (from wherever you choose to save Othello.class): java Othello
